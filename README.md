# Analyzing The Norwegian Oil Fund

## Project Overview

The Government Pension Fund of Norway, also known simply as the Oil Fund, is one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds. At the end of 2022, the fund had a total market value of nearly $1.2 trillion in assets (USD), which equals nearly $233,000 per Norwegian citizen. The fund invests primarily in equities, fixed-income, real estate, and renewable energy infrastructure. A complete list of the funds historical investments can be found on the [Norges Bank Investment Management website.](https://www.nbim.no/en/the-fund/investments/#/)

The funds website provides users with an easy way to view the funds annual holdings, but doesn't offer a lot of options for slicing and dicing the data based on parameters that the user might be interested in. For this project, I wanted to build a tool that addresses this problem, and allows users to slice and dice the data to their hearts desire.

The inspiration for this project came to me when I was conducting some due diligence on my own personal investments. I find that analyzing data in sovereign wealth funds is a good gut check when making investment decisions. My hope is that this project can give others assurance with their investment decisions.
